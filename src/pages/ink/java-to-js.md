### PROLOGUE

My first encounter with Java was October 2014, I guess. Had a lot of unforgetable memories. It's been a hard year, 365 days; I just realized I never had a conversation with nor see her, ofcos I still have her IG notification on. I doubt she still wants to be called [Java](https://instagram.com/yooghurliee) tho.

## JANUARY

I found a new love, this year. Javascript.
[Kadet's](https://kadet.dev/blog/2021-happier-than-ever) and [Yinka's](https://yinkakun.medium.com/my-20-years-in-review-failures-growth-and-new-beginnings-fddf5fcbca0e) 'Year in Reviews' were the motivation I needed to continue a certain course on Web Development. Not to brag, buh JavaScript wasn't so hard to grasp; I guess the feeling was mutual.

## FEBRUARY

I had gained knowledge on the basic possibilities in web dev, it was time to fuck around without being limited to my own knowledge. I built a lot of cool stuffs. Most of them were hosted on Heroku, which are most likely dead links by now, buh I reserved [one](https://bhpwt.csb.app) for you.

## MARCH

The strike started to feel real to me. Actively joined Twitter; the source of my regular dose of motivation, inspiration and oppression. Started a #301daysofcode Challenge, built one or two things before giving up: [Wordle](https://quizzical-pare-16fc99.netlify.app), [a Calculator](https://romantic-beaver-d6d5e0.netlify.app) and [whatnot](https://loving-wing-58bfe6.netlify.app).
Also volunteered to mentor a couple of people, buh now I think about it, I've been a bad one and a quack atleast. I hope they're doing well tho.

## APRIL or so

Every day felt lke the same: watch videos, eat, write code, sleep. I lost track of time too; didn't know when months started nor ended. Ironically or not, It was my most productive months:

- worked with the folks at Frikax to write beautiful (spaghetti?) codes
- took a lot of courses, watched a lot of YouTube videos, read a lot books and whatnot: I was always looking for some other trick to learn 
- actively started mentoring someone.... This time more properly. We did create a lot of cool stuffs too

## August.

We failed to roll out an MVP, buh I did learn a lot and got surprisingly close to some of the folks. Not as close as you think tho, we just probably talk about languages, Frameworks and whatnot.
Writing codes turned to more of a hobby for me. Learnt Vue and Typescript. That was probably when I built [Howdy](https://howdy.goodie.work) and [VSL](https://vsl.goodie.work).

## October.

Decided to build a portfolio, spent half of the month looking for inspiration, a quarter leaning 3d with blender, and the rest wondering how figma works, buh I did get something started. A couple rejected inspiration I found made me build [this](https://untitled01.goodie.work) and [that](https://untitled02.goodie.work)

## November.

My month and literally the worst month of the year.
Almost fell in love, buh God saved me too.... or so I thought.
I also got [a tiny space in the internet that was just about me](https://www.goodie.work)

## December.

Built my confidence enough, discovered a lot of people on twitter, violently applied for roles whenever I was bored, watched a lot of series.
The goal was to savour every moment of the month, since It was my last month in the trenches... or so I think.

### Epilogue
