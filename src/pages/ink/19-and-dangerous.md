# Chapter 1

19

<!-- I had always wanted to do a blog, buh blogs are almost not fun to do. That was when I came across some blog with shitty typography - it was perfect.<br/>
The html.to.design, i got to test it out, it was really cool - changed the whole website to editable designs in a couple minutes.<br/>

## Chapter 2 -->

<!-- You would think there's a happy ending to this, buh I doubt. My Impostor Syndrome came back. I was afraid if i tried building it out, it would turn out perfect. I wanted something as shitty as the original stuff, so i went for it.
Took me a couple thousand seconds to find it on github, and "boom!", The site appeared on this domain.<br/>
It was the perfect opportuinity to lay my hands on both markdown and astro. I had always admired both and trust me, I never want to let go.<br/>
_Is that it?_ -->

### Chapter 3

Maybe not. A couple minutes after writing this, I'll probably add a new feature, a voice thingy - Not an alternative for people allergic to these fonts, buh because people really love my voice. especially the 'S'.

> I hope it doesn't get to frustrating to me, cos i never give up <br/>

Damn. You really are bored, or you probably love reading. So here's another paragraph just for you. **I'm not 19, neither am I dangerous**. Actually, I was somewhere between 19.0864 and 19.1030 at the time of writing. Buh this isn't about any of that, this is about finding out all the things I can do with markdown and probably the speech alternative.<br/>
I promise, there'll be loads of good stuffs on this blog, buh for now. I'm all you've got<br/> -->

~Love, Goody
