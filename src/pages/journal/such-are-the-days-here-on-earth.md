title: "SUCH ARE THE DAYS HERE ON EARTH"
description: "This poem by Aryan Singh was originally written as part of a play in 2019. The play told the story of a man who had lost his love! The main character writes a series of letters informing her about his whereabouts and everyday happenings; this was the final letter he wrote on the night of December 2, 1985â€”the night he becomes a victim of the Bhopal disaster."

Misty mornings, stargaze nights!<br/>
But not all is in harmony - We are at war! Tomorrow not all will continue, the ones who remain will never be the same.<br/>
Such are the days here on Earth!<br/>
Her smiles light up the place, his demise brings us closer,<br/>
My father returned home this week, my brother is still working on his dream, my sister sighs over the rolling ring,<br/>
Such are the days here on Earth!<br/>
I am here like a bridge over troubled waters.<br/>
